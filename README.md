📌 Features
✅ Submit any website URL for scanning
🔍 Get a basic security check with feedback
📊 Clean and responsive user interface (HTML, CSS, JS)
🔒 Backend powered by Flask, ready for extension
🌍 Fully hosted with Render (frontend + backend)
♻️ CORS-enabled to allow frontend-backend communication

🧠 Why WebSecura?
The web is full of vulnerable websites, but security tools are often complex or paid. WebSecura was created to:
1) Educate new developers on basic security scanning
2) Demonstrate full-stack deployment (frontend + backend)
3) Provide a base that can evolve into a serious security tool

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend	Python, Flask
Hosting	Render.com
API Comm.	Fetch + JSON

How It Works
1)User enters a URL on the frontend.
2)The frontend sends a POST request to the Flask backend.
3)The backend performs a basic scan and returns the result as JSON.
4)The result is displayed to the user in a clean format.

Future Plans
✨ Add deeper vulnerability scans
📈 Visual dashboard of scan history
🧠 AI-based suggestions and scoring
🏢 Team dashboard (for orgs and student groups)
📱 PWA/mobile app version
